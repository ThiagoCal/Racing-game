Racing betting game.
I love the concept of the game!
You showed your understanding of the learned material with DOM manipulation,loops,conditionals,advanced array methods- Very impressive!
When styling an element inside javascript with dom manipulation, instead of writing a new line for each style I would do per the example:

Instead of: 
element.style.color="black"
element.style.backgroundColor="white";
element.style.borderColor="black";

I would do:
 element.style="color:black; backgroundColor:white; borderColor:black;"

This will make your code shorter and improve readability.
Also I would define all your elements (document.getElementById/querySelector) at the beggining of the script file and not inside
each function each time you need an element!

You guys did a fantastic job with this project.
